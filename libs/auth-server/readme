auth specification draft

methods:

1. POST /auth - create a new user with some data
2. GET /auth/:login - get data of a given user

notes:

public key should be in pem format, as in the rest of mooncat.

auth server shall not make any assumptions about usage of iv, passwordHash, privateKey.
they should only be used by client.
